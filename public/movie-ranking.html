<h1>Lucas's Top 3 Movie Rankings</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>
<p>I loved the visuals and the action-packed story. The post-apocalyptic world was 
    immersive, and the high-octane sequences made it a thrill to 
    watch from start to finish.</p>
<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>This film resonates with me because it shows how one person can stand up for what’s 
    right and challenge the status quo. The power of reason and conviction is truly 
    inspiring.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings:Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This is a fantastic fantasy film, full of rich storytelling, memorable characters, 
    and stunning visuals. It’s one I can always rewatch and still feel just as captivated 
    as the first time.</p>
