<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm someone who thrives in the great outdoors, especially when it 
  involves mountaineering. The Sierra Mountain Range in California holds a special 
  place in my heart, with Mount Whitney being one of my favorite peaks to climb. 
  I've also had the privilege of scaling some incredible mountains like Mount Shasta, 
  Cotopaxi, Pico de Orizaba, and even completing the Everest Base Camp trek. I 
  attempted to climb Chimborazo, but didn’t make it to the top—however, that 
  experience taught me a lot about resilience, humility, and my own limits. 
  In the future, I’m excited to take on even more challenges, with goals to climb 
  Ama Dablam, Aconcagua, and Alpa Mayo.</p>

<p>When I'm not climbing, you'll find me running, constantly challenging myself 
  and pushing my limits. I’m also passionate about learning and growing in the tech 
  world, diving into both front-end and back-end development. Whether it's on a trail, 
  a peak, or coding away, I’m always seeking new adventures that allow me to grow both
   physically and 
  mentally.</p>
